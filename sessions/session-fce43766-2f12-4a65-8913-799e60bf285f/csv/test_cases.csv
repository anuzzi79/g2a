Given that I'm in equipment detail screen,"When I click to create an observation, I create a new one with draft status, and click ""save & exit,""",Then the observation created should be listed on the piece of equipment with Code = N/A.,
"Given that I created some observations with ""draft"" status within that same piece of equipment","When I randomly access each observation, and change its status randomly according to the options","Then in the screen of equipment detail, the observations should be in ascending order.",
Given that I'm in the detail of an old observation,"When I link that same equipment in the ""asset"" field, and access the piece of equipment","Then the observation should be added to the list and should be sorted according to its ""code"" numbers.",
Given that I'm in the detail of a equipment type,"When I click to create an observation, I create a new one with draft status, and click ""save & exit,""",Then the observation created should be listed on the piece of equipment with Code = N/A.,
"Given that I created some observations with the ""draft"" status within the same equipment type",When I randomly access each observation and change its status randomly according to the options,"Then in the equipment type's detail, the observations should be in ascending order.",
Given that I am in the detail of an old observation,"When I link this same equipment type in the ""asset"" field and then access the equipment type","Then the observation should be added to the list and should be sorted according to its ""code"" numbers.",
Given that I am in the detail of a system,"When I click to create an observation, and create a new one with the draft status, and click ""save & exit,""",Then the created observation should be listed in the system with the Code = N/A.,
"Given that I created some observations with the ""draft"" status within the same system",When I randomly access each observation and change its status randomly according to the options,"Then in the system's detail, the observations should be in ascending order.",
Given that I'm in the detail of an old observation,"When I link that same system in the ""asset"" field and then access the system","Then the observation should be added to the list and sorted according to its ""code"" numbers.",
Given that I'm in the detail of a document,"When I perform the action of linking an existing observation in the system, and select the observation with the highest ""code"" from the list, and repeat the process a few times",Then the document's observations list should be listed and sorted in ascending order.,
Given that I'm in the detail of a document with some linked observations,"When I perform the action of linking existing observations in the system, and link an observation with a ""draft"" status","Then the document's observations list should be listed and sorted in ascending order except for those with a ""N/A"" status.",
"Given that I'm in the detail of a document containing an observation with a ""N/A"" status","When I access that observation and change its status to any available option, and return to that document",Then that modified observation should be in the list organized in ascending order.,
Given that I'm in the SOR subtask list,"When I delete a subtask from the list (e.g., SOR-6), and the order changes to 5>7, and I click the ""reorder subtask"" button",Then the list changes to 5>6>7.,
